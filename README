gTimelapse

(c) Tim Nugent

An application for capturing images to generate timelapse videos, built on gPhoto2 and wxWidgets libraries.


To compile and install
======================

Install wxWdigets and gPhoto2 development libraries. Tested on Ubuntu 13.04 using wx-widgets 2.8.12 and libgphoto2 2.4.14. 

On Ubuntu, you can install these packages:

libgphoto2-2                                               
libgphoto2-2-dev 
libwxbase2.8-0 
libwxbase2.8-dev 
wx-common
wx2.8-headers

Then run:

make

To run
======

- Run 'bin/gtimelapse'
- Make sure your camera is in the correct mode (e.g. normal/PTP etc):
  http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php
- When you've captured your images you can make a video
  using the 'make_vid' script in the src directory (requires
  mencoder)
 
To do
=====

- Refactor code so camera settings are determined whenever 'detect
  camera' is selected, not just at startup.
- Fix camera settings tab - sliding window when there are too many
  setting to fit on the tab.
